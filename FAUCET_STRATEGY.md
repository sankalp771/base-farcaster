# PROOF OF WORK: Mining Testnet ETH (Infinite Faucets)

Since you are now a blockchain developer, you need a steady supply of gas. Here are the "Pro" ways to get ETH without begging.

## 1. The Strategy: "Sepolia PoW" (Proof of Work)
Instead of clicking a captcha, you run a miner on your browser or terminal. You trade your CPU power for ETH. This is the **most reliable** way.

*   **Sepolia PoW Faucet**: [https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/)
    *   **How it works**: Enter your address -> Click "Start Mining".
    *   **Yield**: Leave this tab open overnight. You can mine 1-2 ETH easily.
    *   **Bonus**: No daily limits. You work, you get paid.

## 2. The Bridge: "Holli Sepolia" -> "Base Sepolia"
Testnet ETH is fungible. If you have "Sepolia ETH" (Generic), you can bridge it to "Base Sepolia".

1.  **Get Generic Sepolia ETH**: Use the PoW miner above.
2.  **Bridge It**: Go to [https://superbridge.app/base-sepolia](https://superbridge.app/base-sepolia).
3.  **Deposit**: Send your Sepolia ETH -> Receive Base Sepolia ETH.
    *   *This is usually how devs get massive amounts on Layer 2s.*

## 3. The "Superchain" List
Base is part of the Optimism Superchain. One login often gives you access to many faucets.
*   **Optimism Faucet**: [https://app.optimism.io/faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) (Often supports Base).
*   **Coinbase Wallet Quest**: If you install the Coinbase Wallet extension, they often give you free testnet gas instantly.

## 4. The Last Resort: "Faucet.link"
A vetted list of all working faucets across all chains.

**Pro Tip**: Never buy testnet ETH. If someone tries to sell it to you, it's a scam. Just mine it using method #1.
